# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data 📈 #

• Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database (1 point)

• Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes (3 points)

• Save references to the classes named station and measurement (4 points)

• Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session (1 point)

• Close your session at the end of your notebook (1 point)

  ## Precipitation Analysis 🌧️ ##

• Create a query that finds the most recent date in the dataset (8/23/2017) (2 points)

• Create a query that collects only the date and precipitation for the last year of data without passing the date as a variable (4 points)

• Save the query results to a Pandas DataFrame to create date and precipitation columns (2 points)

• Sort the DataFrame by date (2 points)

• Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method with date as the x and precipitation as the y variables (4 points)

• Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data (2 points)
